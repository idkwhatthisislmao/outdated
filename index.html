hate to break it to u but unfortunately your file is outdated.
i dont think any of ur data should be gone but like u needa get a new file from me

just ask me and then i will give u it on google drive

if you want to understand why i did this then read below: (i will try to explain in a way that you will understand)

so basically the name of the tab when you opened the file was Error, but like mrs nielson kinda caught onto that sorta kinda
so what ima do is make it so then it changes every time you open the file to something educational
and in order to change that, i need to make it so you have to get a new file, because the name of the tab is tied to the file sorta

i hope u understood that
